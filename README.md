# MetaScenario
MetaScenario: A Framework for Driving Scenario Data Description, Storage and Indexing
---

Based on the MetaScenario framework, we adapt and 
store the typical scenario datasets to realize the data adaptation without losing the information 
and accuracy of the original dataset.

Here we select four typical
traffic scenario datasets, NGSIM, HighD, Argoverse, and
Interaction to demonstrate the data adaptation work.

We complete the adaptation storage and processing of the
datasets(refer to InsertDataBase folder), and implement a common visualization program
interface based on the unified database framework to facilitate
researchers to visually observe the driving scenarios embodied
in each dataset(refer to map_visualization and vehicle_visualization).

In vehicle trajectory prediction and planning research field,
many researchers currently favor the format of scene snapshot
images for their input data. Similar to the format
provided by the official [Lyft dataset](https://level-5.global/data/), our data framework
can support a convenient conversion to this format.

To characterize the atom scenarios, we use the structure of
semantic graphs. We need a range of space and time parameters, a
vehicle as ego vehicle, and establish a semantic graph to give a
description of the relationship and state between ego vehicle
and surrounding elements (referring to the components of the
traffic scenario such as vehicles, road network nodes, and lanes).
If the spatial distance exceeds the threshold we set, it is
considered that there is no obvious interaction with the current
ego vehicle. The nodes in the semantic graph represent traffic
elements, storing information such as attributes and categories
of the nodes. The edges store the relationships between the
nodes(refer to relation_extractor and scene_graph_visualization).

We also annotate NGSIM, HighD, Argoverse, and Interaction
datasets stored in the data framework through the temporal and
spatial evolution of the semantic graph, including the begin and
end timestamp of captured scenario fragments, the driving
behaviors generated by the vehicle and the interaction with
adjacent traffic participants(refer to Annotator folder).

Considering the permission of the datasets, we do not 
upload the original datasets here, 
the URL of the relevant dataset is as follows:
